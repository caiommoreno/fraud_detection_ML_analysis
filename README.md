Cyber security going to be one of the most popular topics in a near future. Every information; photo; memories and confidential data going to be stored virtually — with our bank details would be not different.

Big credit card companies normally have a big amount of customers doing more than one transaction by day. To be able to recognize a fraudulent credit card transaction with this huge amount of data, they use a Machine Learning model.

Of course, the raw data needs to be cleaned and prepared to apply any Artificial Intelligence technique.

In this article, it's gonna be presented by a simple way how these companies do that: data analysis; data modeling and Machine Learning creation.

I am sure you're gonna like it ;)
